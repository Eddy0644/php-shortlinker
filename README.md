# php-shortlinker
This is a small PHP program for shorting links for personal users.

As far as I know, many shorteners online are big and messy, full of /* useless */ functions such as advertising.

So I made this program to satisfy my need, that I have a bunch of URLs waiting to be shortened thus I can remember and enterr them quickly on other devices.

I will continue to improve this project.
